# Electronic Test Automation with Python and PyVISA

## Overview

This project focuses on electronic test automation using Python and the PyVISA library. Automation in electronic testing allows for efficient and repeatable testing of electronic devices, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. The use of Python and PyVISA provides a versatile and powerful platform for controlling and interacting with test equipment.

## Features

- **Python Automation:** Leverage the simplicity and flexibility of Python to automate electronic tests.
- **PyVISA Integration:** Utilize PyVISA for communication with test instruments and equipment over various communication protocols such as GPIB, USB, and Ethernet.
- **Syphinc Documentation:** A comprehensive documentation system (Syphinc) is provided to guide users on how to use and integrate the automation scripts into their testing processes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
